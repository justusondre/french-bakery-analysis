## Bakery Sales Conclusion

From the data, we can make many conclusions to why certain options outrank the others, such as costs, room types, and popular neighbourhoods. We concluded that the most expensive homes are located in Manhattan. This could be due to many factors such as competetion for limited supply of affordable housing. This generally causes an increase in affordable housing. Due to lower vacancies, this causes an increase in expenses for property maintenance. 

We extracted from the data that "entire homes/apt" are the most popular options for renting in New York. This means that guests will have the entire home to their selves, and this includes a private entrance, and no shared places. This generally means the guest will have access to a bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen; which is exclusively for them and their personal use. We can conclude that entire homes/apartments are popular because it offers personal space, which allows the guest to have full confidence, and this most likely leads to an increase in satisfaction.
